# Last.fm Discord Rich Presence
A lightweight Discord rich presence application that fetches information from your last.fm profile. 
Your status is updated every 30 seconds and includes information such as your currently playing track, the album it is from, the artist, your playcount for the track, your total scrobbles, a button with a link to your last.fm profile, and when you last scrobbled (if you are currently not listening to music).

Example status:

## Installation and usage
You can download a pre-compiled binary for macOS and linux, as well as an executable for Windows, on the releases page [here.](https://github.com/PvtTyphoon/lfm-rich-presence/releases)
Upon running the binary you will be asked for your last.fm username, and a rpc call to the Discord application will be made to establish your rich presence.
